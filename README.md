## Overview
This repository serves as a learning log for my Machine Learning journey. It covers various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, including mathematical derivations and code implementations.

## Key Highlights

### 1. Linear Regression (Predicting Housing Prices)
* **Goal:** Predict housing prices based on features like area and location.
* **Techniques:** Gradient Descent, Normal Equation.
* **Result:** Achieved an RMSE of X.XX.
* [Link to Notebook](./HW1_Linear_Regression/linear_regression.ipynb)

### 2. Digit Recognition (MNIST)
* **Goal:** Classify handwritten digits (0-9).
* **Techniques:** Neural Networks (MLP), Backpropagation.
* **Result:** 98% accuracy on the test set.
* [Link to Notebook](./HW3_Neural_Networks/mnist_nn.ipynb)

## Libraries Used
